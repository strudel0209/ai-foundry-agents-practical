# Module 2: Tools - Advanced Agent Capabilities

This module explores the tools available to Azure AI Foundry agents, enabling them to perform complex tasks beyond simple text generation. Each tool expands  agent's capabilities in specific ways, from searching through documents to executing custom business logic.

## üéØ Module Overview

Azure AI Foundry agents can be equipped with many tools. Here we explore three fundamental tool types:

1. **[File Search](01-file-search.md)** - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities
2. **[Code Interpreter](02-code-interpreter.md)** - Python code execution and data analysis
3. **[Function Calling](03-function-calling.md)** - Custom business logic integration

## üîÑ Tool Combination Patterns - extend this codebase whit mixing tools

### Pattern 1 example idea: Research & Analysis Workflow

```python
# 1. File Search: Find relevant documents
# 2. Code Interpreter: Analyze extracted data
# 3. Function Calling: Validate and store results
```

### Pattern 2 example idea: Data Processing Pipeline

```python
# 1. Function Calling: Fetch data from APIs
# 2. Code Interpreter: Process and visualize data
# 3. File Search: Compare with historical documents
```

### Pattern 3 example idea: Business Decision Support

```python
# 1. File Search: Retrieve policy documents
# 2. Function Calling: Apply business rules
# 3. Code Interpreter: Generate compliance reports
```

## üîç Best Practices

### Tool Selection Guidelines

1. **File Search** - When you need to:
   - Search through large document collections
   - Provide citations and references
   - Work with static knowledge bases
   - Implement RAG patterns

2. **Code Interpreter** - When you need to:
   - Perform data analysis or calculations
   - Generate visualizations or charts
   - Process uploaded files
   - Execute complex algorithms

3. **Function Calling** - When you need to:
   - Integrate with external systems
   - Execute custom business logic
   - Validate data or enforce rules
   - Perform real-time operations

### Performance Optimization

- **Combine tools strategically** to leverage each tool's strengths
- **Cache function results** to avoid redundant API calls
- **Optimize file search indexes** for faster retrieval
- **Use async patterns** for parallel tool execution

### Security Considerations

- **Validate all inputs** before processing
- **Implement access controls** for sensitive documents
- **Audit tool usage** for compliance requirements
- **Secure external API connections** with proper authentication

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tool configuration errors:**

- Verify tool definitions are properly formatted
