### What is Multi-Agent Orchestration?

Multi-agent orchestration is the intelligent coordination of multiple AI agents to accomplish complex tasks that require:

- **Specialized Expertise**: Different agents with domain-specific capabilities
- **Workflow Coordination**: Structured execution of interdependent tasks
- **Context Management**: Maintaining state and context across agent interactions
- **Result Synthesis**: Combining outputs from multiple agents into coherent results
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of failures and recovery strategies

## üîß Core Orchestration Components

### 1. Intelligent Router
Analyzes incoming requests and determines optimal agent assignment:

- **Request Analysis**: Understanding task requirements and complexity
- **Agent Matching**: Selecting agents based on capabilities and availability
- **Workflow Planning**: Determining execution strategy (sequential, parallel, hybrid)
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing work across available agent instances

### 2. Workflow Engine
Manages the execution of multi-phase workflows:

- **Phase Coordination**: Orchestrating dependent and independent tasks
- **Context Passing**: Maintaining information flow between agents
- **State Management**: Tracking workflow progress and intermediate results
- **Error Recovery**: Handling failures and implementing fallback strategies

### 3. Memory Manager
Handles context and state across complex workflows:

- **Context Retention**: Maintaining relevant information across agent calls
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient storage and retrieval of workflow state
- **Context Summarization**: Condensing information to maintain relevance
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Persistent storage for long-running processes

### 4. Result Synthesizer
Combines outputs from multiple agents into coherent responses:

- **Information Integration**: Merging insights from different agent specializations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling contradictory information from agents
- **Quality Assessment**: Evaluating and ranking agent contributions
- **Response Formatting**: Creating well-structured, actionable outputs
