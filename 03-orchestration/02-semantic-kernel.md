Phase 1: Research ‚Üí Phase 2: Analysis ‚Üí Phase 3: Synthesis ‚Üí Final Result
```

### Key Components

1. **Kernel**: Core orchestration engine
2. **Azure AI Foundry Agents**: Specialized agent instances from Azure AI Foundry
3. **SK Agent Wrappers**: Direct integration layer between SK and Foundry agents
4. **Workflow Coordinator**: Manages agent interactions
5. **Result Synthesizer**: Combines agent outputs

## üöÄ Implementation Approaches

### Creating Azure AI Foundry Agents with Semantic Kernel

Semantic Kernel provides a powerful way to integrate with Azure AI Foundry agents through a direct wrapper approach. This allows you to:

1. **Use the SK Agent interface**: Implement the standard SK Agent interface for consistent patterns
2. **Preserve Azure AI Foundry capabilities**: Maintain all the capabilities of Foundry agents
3. **Leverage SK orchestration**: Take advantage of SK's orchestration capabilities

The implementation involves:

1. Creating an `AIProjectClient` to connect to your Azure AI Foundry project
2. Creating or reusing Azure AI Foundry agents through the client
3. Wrapping these agents in a custom SK Agent implementation
4. Using SK's agent interfaces for invocation and response handling

When implementing the wrapper, it's crucial to handle the Azure AI SDK's patterns correctly:
- Using proper sub-clients (`threads`, `messages`, `runs`)
- Handling `ItemPaged` objects through iteration
- Processing different message content structures
- Managing run statuses properly

### Orchestration Patterns

#### 1. Sequential Orchestration

Sequential orchestration routes a task through a series of specialized agents, with each agent building on the previous agent's work.

**Use Case**: Complex tasks requiring progressive refinement or staged processing.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Define a sequence of specialized agents
- Create a workflow that passes output from one agent to the next
- Each agent adds its expertise to the evolving solution
- Final agent delivers the completed result

**Example Scenario**: Creating a comprehensive market analysis report:
1. Research Specialist gathers relevant data and statistics
2. Analysis Specialist interprets data and identifies patterns
3. Writing Specialist produces a polished final document

#### 2. Round-Robin Discussion

Round-robin discussion enables multiple agents to contribute to a conversation in turns, mimicking a panel discussion.

**Use Case**: Collaborative problem-solving, brainstorming, or multi-perspective analysis.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Initialize a shared conversation context
- Each agent takes turns contributing to the conversation
- All agents have access to the full conversation history
- Process continues for a predetermined number of rounds

**Example Scenario**: Expert panel discussion on a complex topic:
1. Different specialists contribute their perspective in turns
2. Each specialist builds on previous contributions
3. The discussion evolves as multiple viewpoints are considered

#### 3. Concurrent Collaboration

Concurrent collaboration allows multiple agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of a problem.

**Use Case**: Parallel processing of independent sub-tasks or analyzing a problem from multiple angles simultaneously.

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# Key implementation pattern for concurrent orchestration
async def execute_concurrent_workflow(self, request, agents):
    tasks = []
    for agent in agents:
        tasks.append(asyncio.create_task(agent.invoke(request)))
    
    # Wait for all tasks to complete
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    # Synthesize the parallel results
    return await self.synthesize_results(results)
```

**Example Scenario**: Comprehensive product review:
1. Technical Specialist evaluates technical specifications
2. UX Specialist assesses user experience
3. Market Specialist analyzes market positioning
4. Results are synthesized into a comprehensive review

#### 4. Human-in-the-Loop Orchestration

Human-in-the-loop orchestration incorporates human feedback and guidance at critical decision points.

**Use Case**: High-stakes decisions, creative work requiring human judgment, or compliance-critical workflows.

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# Pattern for human-in-the-loop workflow
async def execute_with_human_oversight(self, request, agent, review_points=None):
    # Initial agent response
    initial_response = await agent.invoke(request)
    
    # Request human review
    human_feedback = await self.request_human_feedback(
        initial_response, 
        prompt="Review this response and provide feedback or approval."
    )
    
    if human_feedback.get("approved", False):
        return initial_response
    else:
        # Refine based on feedback
        refined_request = f"""
        Original request: {request}
        Initial response: {initial_response}
        Human feedback: {human_feedback.get('comments', '')}
        
        Please revise your response based on the human feedback.
        """
        return await agent.invoke(refined_request)
```

**Example Scenario**: Content approval workflow:
1. Writing agent drafts content
2. Human reviewer provides feedback
3. Agent refines based on feedback
4. Final human approval before publication

#### 5. Hierarchical Orchestration

Hierarchical orchestration uses a coordinator agent to manage specialized worker agents.

**Use Case**: Complex workflows requiring dynamic task allocation and coordination.

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# Pattern for hierarchical orchestration
async def execute_hierarchical_workflow(self, request):
    # Coordinator agent analyzes the request and creates a plan
    plan = await self.coordinator_agent.create_plan(request)
    
    results = {}
    for task in plan.tasks:
        # Select appropriate agent for each task
        agent = self.select_agent_for_task(task)
        # Execute task
        task_result = await agent.invoke(task.instructions)
        results[task.id] = task_result
    
    # Synthesize results according to the plan
    return await self.coordinator_agent.synthesize_results(plan, results)
```

**Example Scenario**: Complex project management:
1. Manager Agent breaks down a project into tasks
2. Specialized agents are assigned specific tasks
3. Manager Agent monitors progress and coordinates
4. Manager Agent synthesizes the final deliverable

### Advanced Integration Techniques

#### Semantic Kernel Memory Integration

For long-running agent workflows, integrating SK's memory capabilities enables context retention across sessions:

```python
# Pattern for memory integration
async def setup_memory_for_agents(self):
    # Setup memory store
    memory_store = AzureCognitiveSearchMemoryStore(
        search_endpoint=os.getenv('AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT'),
        admin_key=os.getenv('AZURE_AI_SEARCH_API_KEY')
    )
    
    # Create semantic memory instance
    semantic_memory = SemanticTextMemory(
        storage=memory_store,
        embeddings_generator=self.kernel.get_service("text-embedding-ada-002")
    )
    
    # Import memory plugin
    self.kernel.import_plugin(
        TextMemoryPlugin(semantic_memory),
        "memory"
    )
```

#### Multi-Agent Evaluation Framework

For production-grade agent systems, implementing an evaluation framework helps monitor agent performance:

```python
# Pattern for agent evaluation
async def evaluate_agent_performance(self, agent, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        start_time = time.time()
        response = await agent.invoke(test.input)
        execution_time = time.time() - start_time
        
        # Evaluate response quality
        accuracy = await self.evaluate_response_accuracy(response, test.expected_output)
        
        results.append({
            "test_id": test.id,
            "execution_time": execution_time,
            "accuracy": accuracy,
            "response": response
        })
    
    return self.generate_performance_report(results)
```

#### Cross-Model Agent Collaboration

The latest SK features support collaboration between agents powered by different model providers:

```python
# Pattern for cross-model agent collaboration
async def create_cross_model_team(self):
    # Azure OpenAI-powered agent
    azure_agent = AzureAIAgent(
        client=self.ai_client,
        definition=self.foundry_agent,
        kernel=self.kernel
    )
    
    # Anthropic-powered agent via Semantic Kernel
    anthropic_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(
        service=AnthropicChatCompletion(),
        name="AnthropicSpecialist",
        instructions="You are a specialist in creative thinking"
    )
    
    # Local model-powered agent
    local_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(
        service=OllamaService("llama3"),
        name="EfficientReasoner",
        instructions="You perform efficient reasoning tasks"
    )
    
    return {
        "azure_agent": azure_agent,
        "anthropic_agent": anthropic_agent,
        "local_agent": local_agent
    }
```
