## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time: 120 minutes

## üß† Key Concepts

### Advanced Orchestration Architecture

The core of this module is the `exercise_3_advanced_orchestration.py` script, which demonstrates how to build a robust, memory-aware multi-agent orchestration system using Semantic Kernel and Azure AI Foundry agents.

#### What Does the Exercise Do?

- **Initializes Semantic Kernel** with Azure OpenAI chat and embedding services.
- **Configures a vector memory store** (in-memory for development, Azure AI Search for production) for storing and retrieving workflow context.
- **Registers multiple specialized agents** (policy expert, financial analyst, integration specialist) with distinct capabilities.
- **Implements intelligent routing**: Requests are analyzed semantically and routed to the most appropriate agent(s) using SK prompt functions.
- **Executes collaborative workflows**: For complex requests, multiple agents are coordinated, and their outputs are synthesized into a unified response.
- **Maintains and utilizes memory/context**: All agent interactions are stored as vector records, enabling context-aware responses and memory search.
- **Demonstrates memory-aware workflows**: Shows how previous interactions enhance future agent responses and enables filtered/hybrid search in production.
- **Saves all results and memory traces** to a JSON file for inspection and further analysis.

### Key Components

1. **MultiAgentOrchestrator Class**: Central coordinator that manages agent registration, memory, routing, and workflow execution.
2. **Semantic Request Analysis**: Uses SK prompt functions to analyze incoming requests and select optimal agents.
3. **Dynamic Agent Selection**: Supports both single-agent and multi-agent collaborative workflows.
4. **Memory Manager**: Stores every agent interaction as a vector record, enabling semantic search and context propagation.
5. **Result Synthesizer**: Combines outputs from multiple agents using SK prompt functions for coherent, business-ready responses.

## üöÄ Implementation Guide

### Deep Dive: Advanced Functionality in `exercise_3_advanced_orchestration.py`

#### 1. Semantic Kernel Integration

- **Service Setup**: Adds Azure OpenAI chat and embedding services to the kernel.
- **Prompt Functions**: Uses SK's prompt templating and execution settings for both routing and synthesis.
- **Async Workflows**: All orchestration logic is asynchronous for scalability.

#### 2. Vector Memory Store

- **Flexible Backend**: Automatically chooses between in-memory and Azure AI Search based on environment variables.
- **WorkflowMemoryRecord Model**: Custom dataclass for storing agent interactions, requests, responses, context, and embeddings.
- **Semantic Search**: Uses embeddings to find relevant past interactions, supporting advanced filtering and hybrid search in production.

#### 3. Agent Registration and Management

- **Specialized Agents**: Registers agents with distinct roles and capabilities (document analysis, code execution, integration).
- **Azure AI Foundry Integration**: Manages agent threads, messages, and runs for robust conversation handling.

#### 4. Intelligent Routing

- **Semantic Analysis**: Analyzes each request using SK prompt functions to determine which agent(s) should handle it.
- **Context Propagation**: Enhances agent requests with relevant memory/context from previous interactions.

#### 5. Collaborative Workflows

- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: For complex requests, orchestrates sequential or parallel agent execution.
- **Result Synthesis**: Uses SK prompt functions to synthesize multiple agent outputs into a single, comprehensive business report.

#### 6. Memory-Aware Features

- **Embedding Generation**: Uses Azure OpenAI embeddings for semantic memory.
- **Context Enhancement**: Automatically includes relevant history in agent requests.
- **Filtered and Hybrid Search**: Supports advanced memory queries, including filtering by agent and hybrid vector/keyword search in Azure AI Search.
- **Persistence**: Ensures all interactions are stored for future retrieval and context enhancement.

#### 7. Output and Analysis

- **Result Saving**: All workflow results and memory traces are saved to `output/advanced_orchestration_results.json`.
- **Serialization**: Converts custom memory record objects to dictionaries for compatibility with JSON.

### Example Workflow

1. **Policy Compliance Review**: Routes to the policy expert agent, analyzes the remote work policy, and provides compliance recommendations.
2. **Financial Performance Analysis**: Routes to the financial analyst agent, processes Q3 financial data, and generates a metrics dashboard.
3. **Integrated Business Report**: Synthesizes outputs from multiple agents for a comprehensive business report.
4. **Memory-Aware Follow-Up**: Uses stored memory to summarize key findings from previous reviews.
5. **Memory Demonstration**: Shows how memory/context enhances agent responses and supports advanced search.
